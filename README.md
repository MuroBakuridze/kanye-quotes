Authentication and API Security


Benefits of Laravel Sanctum:
Easy to Implement: Sanctum is easy to set up and integrate with existing Laravel applications.
Versatile: It supports both session-based authentication for web applications and token-based authentication for APIs.
Secure: Sanctum uses Laravelâ€™s built-in CSRF protection to secure your application.

API Token Security
The /api/quotes endpoint is secured with an API token to ensure that only authenticated users can access it. This adds an extra layer of security by preventing unauthorized access.
